# chat-program
Java based client-server chat program for desktop and Android.

**Chat-program** is a simple chat program. It allows instant, lightweight text
communication between any device running Java (this includes the Android
application).

**How to use:**
1. Start the Server on a desktop. This can be Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.
2. Select a port to use (port forward ONLY IF NEEDED), and click start.
3. Open the client application. Enter the IP address and port
   of the server. Enter a username, then connect.
4. Enter messages and hit send to chat.

The program can run on either 32- or 64-bit systems running Java.

**Future plans:**
1. Improve design of Android app
2. Fix restarting server without closing
3. Implement remote server management
4. Detect if client has been inactive for too long, then request a kick
